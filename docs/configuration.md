# Configuration

Authelia is highly configurable thanks to a configuration file. 
There is a documented template configuration, called [config.template.yml](./config.template.yml), at
the root of the repository. All the details are documented there.

When running **Authelia**, you can specify your configuration file by passing
the file path as the first argument of **Authelia**.
